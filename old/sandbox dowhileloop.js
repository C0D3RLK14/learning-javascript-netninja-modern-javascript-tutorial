// do while loops
let i = 4;
do {
    console.log("value of i :", i);
    i++;
} while(i < 5); //here ';' is necessary bcz the while statement is outside the code block

// NOTE: A 'Do While Loop' is used when we need to run code block atleast once no matter the condition is met, and would iterate if the condition is met
